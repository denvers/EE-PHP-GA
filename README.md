# Server-Side Google Analytics PHP Client

**Watch-out: This is just a proof-of-concept. Don't use in a production environment!
**

This addon enables you to implement Google Analytics in your ExpressionEngine site, the cookie-less way. Really nice if you're fighting with the recent EU rules about cookies.

*Currently only supports the `trackPageView` method of Google Analytics.*
